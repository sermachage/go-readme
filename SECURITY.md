## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, report them privately via [GitHub's security advisory feature](https://github.com/sermachage/go-readme/security/advisories/new).

You can expect an acknowledgement within **48 hours** and a fix or mitigation plan within **7 days** for confirmed issues.
